## guesss-number - Code for Assignment 2 for ISSE, 04-800 I, Fall 2023
    
__INTRODUCTION__

This repo contains a program that determines the number that has been picked by the user by successively guessing numbers and then asking the user whether the answer is higher or lower than the guess.

__DESCRIPTION__
    
The guesss-number program guesses a number, and allow the user to enter one of three characters in response:


| If the answer isâ€¦              | User types            |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| HIGHER than the programâ€™s guess | H |
| LOWER than the programâ€™s guess            | L            |
| Correct             | =             |

- The program repeats this process until it gets the correct answer, at which point the program should terminate (when user entered '=' or answered inconsistently). 
- Once the program has gotten the number correct, it prints out how many guesses were required.
- It is able to determine that the user has answered inconsistently. For that, it prints an error message and exit.
- It is also possible to change the guessing range by simply updating the one #define value.

__IMPORTANCE__

This program may be needed for various purposes including: learning, gaming, ...
